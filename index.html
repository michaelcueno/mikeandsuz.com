   FAQ
  </h2>
  <strong>Is there a shuttle to the Venue?</strong><br>
  <p>
    Yep! But only for hotel guests at Amor Boutique Hotel (leaves at 4:15pm from the hotel). If you're not staying at the hotel, find your way to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZLWrfV3Kc4xWD9ed7" target="_blank">the venue which is located here!</a>
  </p>
  <strong>Should I get pesos?</strong>
  <p>
  Yes, bring a debit card so you can get cash out of ATMs in town. Not everywhere you go is going to take a credit card (though most will), it's good to have some cash on hand. US dollars are also typically accepted, but you're not going to get the best exchange rate. </p>
  </p>
  <strong>Should I rent a car?</strong>
  <p>
    If you're just planning to stay within Sayulita, we wouldn't recommend a car. You can rent a golf cart once you're in town, but you can also easily walk to anywhere within town.  
    If you are planning on exploring more of the surrounding areas, a car might be worth while, but driving in Sayulita can be a little hectic. 
  </p>
  <strong>Should I drink the water?</strong>
  <p>
    No! Don't risk it! Best to only drink bottled water while you're here.
  </p>
  <strong>What should I wear - to the ceremony?</strong>
  <p>We'll be on the sand - so keep that in mind. Beach Formal? Truth is we don't really care, maybe no jeans, you all know how to look nice.</p>
  <strong>What should I wear - to the welcome dinner?</strong>
  <p>Come as you are! We're going to dress up a bit becuase we want to, but it's not required!</p>
  <strong>What timezone is Sayulita in?</strong>
  <p>Central Standard Time (same as Chicago, 2hrs ahead of Seattle).</p>
  <strong>What should I bring on the boat tour (day after wedding)?</strong>
  <p>Pack like your going to the beach - wear a swimsuit, bring a towel and rub on sunscreen (spray on not allowed on the boat).</p>
  <strong>Will it be lit?</strong>
  <p>I'm not sure what that means, but I think so.</p>

    We picked <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/M9pRQNbUhfELb4yGA">Sayulita, Mexico</a> for it's laid back, surfer beach town vibes.

  <strong>How do I get there from the airport?</strong><br>
  Sayulita is a 40 minute drive from the Puerto Vallarta International Airport. There are a few options to get there:
  <br></br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Taxi</strong> - Taxis only take cash, so make sure to have some on hand. They will take US Dollars but you're likely to get overcharged. If you can, best to exchange some money for Pesos when you arrive at the Airport. Expect to pay somewhere between 30-50 USD for a Taxi.</li>
    <li><strong>Private Shuttle</strong> - You can book a private Shuttle to pick you up from the airport. This is a good option if you have a group or just want someone to hand you a beer as soon as you get on the road. We've used <a href='https://www.sayulitalife.com/sayulita-suburban'>Sayulita Suburban</a> in the past, and they're great. You can also book a shuttle directly through the hotel by emailing <a href="mailto:info@amorboutiquehotel.com">info@amorboutiquehotel.com</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Uber</strong> - Uber does operate in Sayulita and Puerto Vallarta, but they are not allowed in the airport. You'll need to walk outside of the airport if you want to take an Uber. We recommend using a Taxi or Shuttle from the airport, and only using Uber once you're in Sayulita.</li>

  <h3>Booking Instructions</h3>
  <p>
    We have a room block for the hotel, you just need to tell the booking manager our names (Kraus/Cueno) and the date of the wedding (Jan 20th 2023). 
    <br><br>
    To book, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@amorboutiquehotel.com">info@amorboutiquehotel.com</a>. 
    <br><br>
    <strong><a target="_blank" href="/hotel_block.html">Click here for the full list of the rooms and villas we have in our block.</a></strong>

    (Of course you're free to book any rooms outside the room block as well, directly on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amorboutiquehotel.com">their website</a>)
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4>One word of caution! </h4>
  <p>
    The hotel doesn't have any elevators and some of the villas are pretty high off sea level - so if you're not up for hiking up a few stairs, make sure to pick a room or villa closer to ground level. (The hotel website will tell you how many stairs it takes to get to each room).
